                <p>This application is very simple. When you
    participate, the platform will load a scanned table of statistical
    data referring either to agricultural production or to human
    census records
    for different regions of southern and eastern Asia during the
    1920s and 1930s. Once the image has been loaded, you will be asked
    to transcribe the contents of the table you see. Any further
    information can be placed in the top row, the bottom row or an
    extra final column (see below). An example portion of a 1921 and 1931 Indian census table is provided below.</p>

                <p>Please do not translate anything
                     (e.g. don't translate Dutch into English), just
                     transcribe it,
            and retain the case of the word as it was originally
            written. When the table is first loaded, you will be prompted to define the correct number of
            total columns in the loaded table, so please check this
            carefully. We suggest that you add an extra column to
                     the total number of observed columns and use it
                     for passing on your own
                     comments (e.g. if the observable table
                     has 4 columns, stipulate 5 columns and use the
                     last one for your own remarks). Please transcribe any table title or caption
                     into either the top or bottom row of your spreasheet, after you have entered the table, but otherwise
                     please ignore any further extraneous text on the
                     scanned page (e.g. page numbers). The number of rows will expand as you type. If
                     a word looks fuzzy, do you best to identify it
                     and make a comment in your extra column to note
                     the problem. If there happen to be two or more
                     tables on the same page, then skip a line and
                     continue transcribing each table.</p>

	      <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you find it easier, you can transcribe into
                     an offline spreadsheet and then copy-and-paste
                     the results into the online table in one go. However, bear in mind that
                     a delay in submitting the online table
                     might then mean that other
                     contributors complete this task before you do and
                     thereby make your efforts unnecessary!</p>
